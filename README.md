# The "#"

I gotta be honest, I can't recall why I made it in the first place ðŸ˜‚, probably due to kill some time, the only thing I know for sure is that I got inspired by a video of The Coding Train doing the same, but you know, doing it like 10x better than me and with dedicated technologies.

This version of # is just as complex as the RL one.

I decided to choose DOM over any library or other graphics thing to to the job due to knowing that it doesn't need any dependancies to run, and is vanilla JS, something that I'm a fan of. ~~What about canvas? bro, back then, I didn't know that was even a thing, but we don't talk about that.~~

~~No, bro, using DOM, doesn't force me to use OOP, possibly makes things easier, but that is not how I like things, while you solve your problem in a minute using an external tool or by taking an easier path to the result, I'm here struggling to get something working in a way that I like for hours, that is how life is meant to be lived, but we don't talk about that.~~ 

It includes an AI to compete with if you're playing alone, but it isn't truly an AI *(everyone pretends that any somewhat complex program is AI, so the "AI" thing stays)*, is just an algorithm and it's very bad, it just selects a random valid cell, yeah, intelligent. ðŸ‘Œ

And last but not least, the whole project was coded in spanish, since that is my native language for those who are wondering why there is a code line that goes: ```var carlitos = -32``` 

*(It might to useful to let people know that some stuff will appear in spanish due to things... ok, I gotta edit the readme in the profile real quick, and yep, that was it, bye)*

~~Why the project was made in 2021 and just today in nearly 2023 I decided to shared it? It's not like I didn't have GitHub until 2 weeks ago, is just we don't talk about that.~~
